# Changelog — playlist-builder

## 0.2.0 — 2026-06-19 (eval suite)

Adds the first machine-runnable eval suite (5 evals) and bumps SKILL.md to v0.2.0.

- `evals/evals.json` — 5 evals: preflight-required-before-tracklist,
  no-fabrication-when-sparse (three-tier honesty block), content-propriety-
  filter default (explicit tracks filtered), teach-friendliness weighting
  for D-bank peak selection, and unknown-context fallback disclosed.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-10

Initial repo snapshot (sourced from `/home/tony/.claude/skills/playlist-builder`)
plus the catalog/auth-state preflight contract from issue #72.

- **New `scripts/inspect_catalog.py`** — preflight that reports seed-bank
  counts, Mode B (Tony catalog) presence, Spotify/SoundCloud auth signals,
  and a `recommended_output_mode` field with one of four values:
  `verified`, `search-assisted`, `sparse`, `manual-curation`.
- **`SKILL.md` Step 3.5 — catalog/auth-state preflight (REQUIRED)** —
  spelled out as required, not optional, before any tracklist generation.
  Driven by lessons from Round 7 TwinGrid lane Gina, where both Claude
  and Codex agents fabricated plausible-but-unverified track names when
  the bundled catalog was sparse.
- **`SKILL.md` output schema** — every generator row must carry the seven
  required fields: `phase`, `bank`, `search_string`, `approx_duration`,
  `exact_id_status`, `verification_required`, `platform_auth_available`.
- **`SKILL.md` "When candidate playlists are useful but not paste-ready"** —
  documents the verification contract for `search-assisted` and `sparse`
  outputs.
- **`scripts/generate_playlist.py`** — added `--catalog-state {auto,
  verified, search-assisted, sparse, manual-curation}` and `--skill-dir`
  flags; `--catalog` is no longer required when mode is `sparse` or
  `manual-curation`. New `emit_honesty_block()` produces the three-tier
  output for `sparse` mode and the curation-prompt-only output for
  `manual-curation` mode.
- **`references/HONESTY_MODES.md`** — full taxonomy, schema, and worked
  examples for each mode.
- **`tests/test_inspect_catalog.py`** — 10 focused unit tests covering
  every mode-selection path, malformed-JSON robustness, missing-file
  handling, and the schema contract.
- **Frontmatter** — added top-level `version` and `last-updated` to keep
  the skill out of `skills-meta` drift on day 1.
- **Source artifacts** — Round 7 evidence at
  `/tmp/twingrid-r7-claude-gina-yin-core-restore/skill-improvement-recommendation.md`
  and `/tmp/twingrid-r7-codex-gina-core-restore-yin/partner-peek-improvements.md`
  drove this design.
